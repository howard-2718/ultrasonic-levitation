# ultrasonic-levitation

![Project Banner](/img/banner.png)

Levitation of styrofoam beads, with real-time keyboard control, path tracing, and more!

*This is a capstone project for the University of British Columbia (UBC) Engineering Physics (ENPH) Project Lab.*

This repository consists of:
* Files created by [our progenitors](https://github.com/ultrasonic-homies/ultrasonic-holography/tree/main), which are required for setup and operation of the system, and
* Files created by us, which add improved functionality and the ability to test system behaviours.

To learn more about our project, see either our detailed [final report](final-report.pdf) or our easier-to-digest poster, shown below.

For more detailed instructions on how to setup the system, please refer to [our progenitors' repository](https://github.com/ultrasonic-homies/ultrasonic-holography/tree/main). We have renamed the *rust_sonic_surface* folder to *rust_solver*.
