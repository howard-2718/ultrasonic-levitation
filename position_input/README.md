# Instructions for setting up position input

Our position input files make use of a Python virtual environment (venv) as well as a different file structure than what is used in this repository. Therefore, **the *.bat* files may require significant modifications in order to properly execute**.

The file *kb.bat* executes keyboard and preprogrammed line position control, whereas *canvas.bat* executes path following position control.

To modify the *.bat* files:
1. Create a new [Python venv](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html).
2. Edit all file paths in the *.bat* files to point to the actual file locations.
